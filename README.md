Samples for JRubyArt (formerly ruby-processing-3.0)

Mostly done and includes cf3 examples.

As I work through the examples I am finding that some static sketches (all in setup) may no-longer work and benefit from a draw loop, JAVA2D appears flakey sometimes a blank frame and sometimes nothing. P2D is probably the most reliable substitute as FX2D is a work in progress (confirmed by Ben Fry, that neverthless looks promising).
