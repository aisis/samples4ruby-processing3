Samples for ruby-processing-3.0 (might become JRubyArt)

Only a few samples to start with but I am building them up

As I work through the examples I am finding that some static sketches (all in setup) may no-longer work and benefit from a draw loop, JAVA2D appears flakey sometimes a blank frame and sometimes nothing. P2D is probably the most reliable substitute as FX2D is a work in progress (confirmed by Ben Fry, that neverthless looks promising).
