Here we assume you rename library `hype` and jar `hype.jar` you know it makes sense to use simple lowercase names. I am not sure such method chaining makes sense in ruby there may be neater alternatives. I do facilitate method chaining with the vecmath classes Vec2D and Vec3D (by returning self) but for the processing Applet class this may be undesirable. Ayway finally got `magnetic swarm` sketch to work, secret was `to_java(Java::Hype::HDrawable)` that eluded me owing to paucity of jruby documentation.

In any event we would probably refactor the code in ruby to create a factory module for HRect class to dry the code up a bit, if it was not an example.
