Here we assume you rename library `hype` and jar `hype.jar` you know it makes sense to use simple lowercase names. I am not sure such method chaining makes sense in ruby there may be neater alternatives. I do facilitate method chaining with the vecmath classes Vec2D and Vec3D (by returning self) but for the processing Applet class this may be undesirable. Anyway finally got `magnetic swarm` sketch to work, by implementing the `HCallback` interface as a block (I wanted to do that from the outset) but was obviously doing something wrong (NB: cast to Drawable is not required, as I had first thought).
