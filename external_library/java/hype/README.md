Here we assume you rename library `hype` and jar `hype.jar` you know it makes sense to use simple lowercase names. I am not sure such method chaining makes sense in ruby there may be neater alternatives. I do facilitate method chaining with the vecmath classes Vec2D and Vec3D (by returning self) but for the processing Applet class this may be undesirable. Anyway finally got `magnetic swarm` sketch to work, by implementing the `HCallback` interface as a block (I wanted to do that from the outset) but what I did not clock originally was that I needed to cast the java object to `HDrawable` (and abstract class). The realising what I needed to do it took me some time to figure out I needed `to_java(Java::Hype::HDrawable)` that eluded me owing to paucity of jruby documentation (which I have fixed to some extent on the JRuby wiki).
