Here we assume you rename library `hype` and jar `hype.jar` you know it makes sense to use simple lowercase names. I am not sure such method chaining makes sense in ruby there may be neater alternatives. I do facilitate method chaining with the vecmath classes Vec2D and Vec3D (by returning self) but for the processing hype classes this may be undesirable (pretty inflexible and tightly coupled to processing app). Anyway finally got `magnetic swarm` sketch to work, by implementing the `HCallback` interface as a block (I wanted to do that from the outset) but was obviously doing something wrong (NB: cast to Drawable is not required, as I had first thought).
