# Samples for JRubyArt-1.0.6+
Sketches here demonstrate the the Slider library funtionality, that provide in sketch sliders for JRubyArt. Quite eas interface with rich functionality. Originally took too long to load, seems to be fixed by adding classpath to `rp_extras.jar` manifest. Slider supports keyboard and mouse operations (including scroll wheel and an accelerated variant).
