###README

Sketches in this folder may need to be run with the jruby-complete ie "--nojruby" flag (unless you have set `JRUBY: 'false'` in config.yml). You can use processing-3.0+ to install the sound library from processing.org.  This library has been adopted by processing.org, although the minim library is still available to install from the processing ide.
